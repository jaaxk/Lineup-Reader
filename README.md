# Lineup-Reader
A problem I always had when looking at music festival lineups was that I saw a big list of artists that I did not know.
This project reads in a festival flyer and extracts all the artists.
It then accesses Spotify's API to find the artist, and returns the genres and top songs of that artist in a Pandas DataFrame
This project requires a virtual environment with the requirements listed in the requirements.txt file.
This can be done by running: pip install -r requirements.txt
